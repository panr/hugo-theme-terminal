## Features

#### Built-in shortcodes

- **`image`** (prop required: **`src`**; props optional: **`alt`**, **`position`** (**left** is default | center | right), **`style`**)
  - eg: `{{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}`
- **`figure`** (same as `image`, plus few optional props: **`caption`**, **`captionPosition`** (left | **center** is default | right), **`captionStyle`**
  - eg: `{{< figure src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Hello Friend!" captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: red;" >}}`

#### Code highlighting

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git) and pasting it to `themes/terminal` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. You can also include it as a git submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "terminal"
paginate = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your blog content (default is `content/posts`)
  contentTypeName = "posts"
  # ["orange", "blue", "red", "green", "pink"]
  themeColor = "orange"
  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2
  # set theme to full screen width
  fullWidthTheme = false
  # center theme with default width
  centerTheme = false
  # set a custom favicon (default is a `themeColor` square)
  # favicon = "favicon.ico"

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    title = "Terminal"
    subtitle = "A simple, retro theme for Hugo"
    keywords = ""
    copyright = ""
    menuMore = "Show more"
    readMore = "Read more"
    readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"

    [languages.en.params.logo]
      logoText = "Terminal"
      logoHomeLink = "/"

    [languages.en.menu]
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "about"
        name = "About"
        url = "/about"
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "showcase"
        name = "Showcase"
        url = "/showcase"
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields. In case you need, here's [a YAML version](https://gist.github.com/panr/9eeea6f595c257febdadc11763e3a6d1).

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that currently `main menu` doesn't support nesting.

## Post archetype

See the basic `post` file params supported by the theme â€” https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/archetypes/post.md

## Add-ons

- **Comments** â€” for adding comments to your blog posts please take a look at `layouts/partials/comments.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/comments.html.  
- **Extended Head** â€” please take a look at `layouts/partials/extended_head.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_head.html  
- **Extended Footer** â€” please take a look at `layouts/partials/extended_footer.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_footer.html

## How to run your site

From your Hugo root directory run:

```
$ hugo server -t terminal
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.

## How to edit the theme

If you have to override some of the styles, **you can do this easily** by adding `static/style.css` in your root directory and point things you want to change.

Otherwise, if you really want to edit the theme, you need to install Node dependencies. To do so, go to the theme directory (from your Hugo root directory):

```
$ cd themes/terminal
```

and then run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm i yarn
$ yarn
```
