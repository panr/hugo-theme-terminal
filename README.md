- fully responsive

#### Built-in shortcodes

- **`image`** (prop required: **`src`**; props optional: **`alt`**, **`position`** (**left** is default | center | right), **`style`**)
  - eg: `{{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}`
- **`figure`** (same as `image`, plus few optional props: **`caption`**, **`captionPosition`** (left | **center** is default | right), **`captionStyle`**)
  - eg: `{{< figure src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Hello Friend!" captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: red;" >}}`
- **`code`** (prop required: **`language`**; props optional: **`title`**, **`id`**, **`expand`** (default "â–³"), **`collapse`** (default "â–½"), **`isCollapsed`**)
  - eg:
  ```go
  {{< code language="css" title="Really cool snippet" id="1" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="true" >}}
  pre {
    background: #1a1a1d;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    font-size: 1rem;
    overflow: auto;

    @media (--phone) {
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      word-wrap: break-word;
    }

    code {
      background: none !important;
      color: #ccc;
      padding: 0;
      font-size: inherit;
    }
  }
  {{< /code >}}
  ```

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git) and pasting it to `themes/terminal` in your root directory.

You can also clone it directly to your Hugo folder:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

If you don't want to make any radical changes, it's the best option, because you can get new updates when they are available. You can also include it as a git submodule:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
```

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "terminal"
paginate = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your main content (default is `content/posts`).
  # the list of set content will show up on your index page (baseurl).
  contentTypeName = "posts"

  # ["orange", "blue", "red", "green", "pink"]
  themeColor = "orange"

  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2

  # show selector to switch language
  showLanguageSelector = false

  # set theme to full screen width
  fullWidthTheme = false

  # center theme with default width
  centerTheme = false

  # set a custom favicon (default is a `themeColor` square)
  # favicon = "favicon.ico"

  # set post to show the last updated
  # If you use git, you can set `enableGitInfo` to `true` and then post will automatically get the last updated
  showLastUpdated = false
  # Provide a string as a prefix for the last update date. By default, it looks like this: 2020-xx-xx [Updated: 2020-xx-xx] :: Author
  # updatedDatePrefix = "Updated"

  # set all headings to their default size (depending on browser settings)
  # it's set to `true` by default
  # oneHeadingSize = false

[params.twitter]
  # set Twitter handles for Twitter cards
  # see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution
  # do not include @
  creator = ""
  site = ""

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    languageName = "English"
    title = "Terminal"
    subtitle = "A simple, retro theme for Hugo"
    owner = ""
    keywords = ""
    copyright = ""
    menuMore = "Show more"
    readMore = "Read more"
    readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"
    missingContentMessage = "Page not found..."
    missingBackButtonLabel = "Back to home page"

    [languages.en.params.logo]
      logoText = "Terminal"
      logoHomeLink = "/"

    [languages.en.menu]
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "about"
        name = "About"
        url = "/about"
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "showcase"
        name = "Showcase"
        url = "/showcase"
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields. In case you need, here's [a YAML version](https://gist.github.com/panr/9eeea6f595c257febdadc11763e3a6d1).

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that currently `main menu` doesn't support nesting.

## Post archetype

See the basic `post` file params supported by the theme â€” https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/archetypes/posts.md

## Add-ons

- **Comments** â€” for adding comments to your blog posts please take a look at `layouts/partials/comments.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/comments.html.
- **Extended Head** â€” please take a look at `layouts/partials/extended_head.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_head.html
- **Extended Footer** â€” please take a look at `layouts/partials/extended_footer.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_footer.html

## How to run your site

The theme is using [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/) to handle Javascript and PostCSS files. This setup **requires** following npm packages: `@babel/core`, `@babel/cli` and `postcss-cli`. Before you start, you have to install them (globally or locally). Here's how you can set it all up from your Hugo root directory by running:

```
yarn add -D @babel/core @babel/cli postcss-cli
cd themes/terminal
git checkout v2
yarn
cd ../..
```

Then:

```
$ hugo server -t terminal
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.

## How to edit the theme

If you have to override some of the styles, **you can do this easily** by adding `static/style.css` in your root directory and point things you want to change.
But you can also copy `assets` folder from the theme to your root directory and modify the files. This will protect your changes from the override when you update the theme.
